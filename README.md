# Family Trust
The parents can set up a family trust to help secure the future for their children.
The funds in this trust can be used for different things:
- Pay for university
- Pay for allowances
- Used for inheritence

The parents will be the admins of the trust, they can add, transfer, lock and unlock the funds. The kids however will only be able to check the balances in the trust and withdraw funds according to the conditions set by the parents. For example, the funds in the university bucket can be locked until the kids are ready to get into university.
Another example would be if the parents pass away, then the funds can be unlocked after a set duration of inactivity in the parents account.
